To keep the repository organized, the project has been divided into multiple folders, one for each exercise,
each containing the MATLAB functions used to solve the corresponding problem.
In the case of the "ASSIGNMENT_3_implementations_tests" folder, it also includes the results of the tests performed.

It is important to note, however, that the MATLAB scripts placed inside the individual exercise folders are intended solely for informational and organizational purposes. 
These scripts cannot be executed directly from within those folders. 

To properly run and test the code, it is necessary to use the corresponding script located in the "A_all_functions" directory
